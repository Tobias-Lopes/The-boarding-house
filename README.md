# The-boarding-house
The owner of a boarding house has ten rooms to rent to students, these rooms being identified by numbers 0 to 9.

Reads a quantity N representing the number of students who will rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10). It then records the rent for the N students. For each rental record, enter the student's name and email, as well as which of the rooms they chose (from 0 to 9).
